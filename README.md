# stateChangeGameCS439

Continuing with the rocket theme I decided to make this game be the prequel to my first game I made in simpleGE. I wanted to focus on learning states over learning traditional programming. The tool twinery.org is great at simplifying the process to become a functional standalone state diagram.


I used twine to create my project because the demonstration of twine in class made a lot of sense to me

In order to run the project, download and run the HTML file labeled "rocketStory" 

Each node is in twine's database and was copied from the google sheets outline- attached

Nodes are linked by "edges." I used twine so the edges are denoted by arrows in the diagram and square brackets in text

I learned that a lot of logic is hidden by using a state machine, especially when looking at a state that is only accessible from a previous state. The nodes serve to not have to track every single condition and allow much easier expansion. I know from experience that lots of if statements are hard to manage and using a state machine you can avoid checking so many if's. (EXAMPLE: the support bool in sheets isnt needed since the only way to access the launch node is if you already have support)

I'm most proud of the spreadsheet I made since the formatting allowed me to recreate the game in twine to be playable very easily. 

I would like to link my space landing game to play if you "win" the CYOA game
